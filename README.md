# Aura

## Abstract
One of the current problems in the music industry, specifically with streaming services is that artists receive very low payments for the exploitation of their music. If we put spotify as an example, it is really hard for an artist to know for sure how much money is receiving for each reproduction due to the complex algorithms used by the platform.

Furthermore, it is not possible for an independent artist to directly add their music to these platforms since it is necessary to do it through an aggregator who either prepares an "x" amount of money for the service or retains a percentage of the profits for the exploitation of the artist's works.

Of course, for the final consumer (the fans) it is great to have services that allow them to consume all their favorite music in one place and even at a low price, however for independent artists, who represent the great majority of the industry, this model is simply not profitable.

The era of the big labels has been left behind, nowadays independent artists dominate the scene more and more, for that reason a platform is necessary that concentrates its efforts in creating a profitable business model for them that are the ones who produce the raw material.

Aura is a decentralized music network where the artist can publish his music to millions of users around the world and earn royalties without intermediaries.

## How it works?
Aura uses blockchain technology to distribute music through thousands of nodes distributed through all its users (artists, fans, record labels and rights administrators).

Wait a second. Did not you say that the third parties were no longer necessary?

That's right, in Aura you do not need an aggregator, label or rights administrator, however these entities can also access the service without them monopolizing all the profits, we'll talk about it later.

In order to create an artist stream you need to run a publisher node, or use our web service. In this way you can publish and manage all your music.
